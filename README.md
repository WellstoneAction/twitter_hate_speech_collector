Two scripts exist for grabbing tweets and dumping to csv:

(1) grab_last_week_of_tweets.py Uses the Twitter search API and the tweepy module to get the last week or so of tweets (Twitter API limitation) matching a search query.

(2) parse_advanced_search_results.py Uses lxml to scrape results from the HTML generated by an advanced search on Twitter's site.
